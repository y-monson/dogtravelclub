  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>This blog started out of necessity to figure out a 
    pain-free way to travel with my dogs around Europe. Now that I have learned 
  some do's and don'ts, I would love to share my experience. 
  <br>Most importantly, it is always great to hear what you have to say about your
    experience travelling around Europe with your pet. I hope this site helps you 
    plan out your next trip!</p>
